Using these patch files to patch a twrp minimal manifest for building OrangeFox:

1. Sync the relevant twrp minimal manifest, with the correct branch
2. Change to the manifest's "build" subdirectory
3. Run the command: patch -p1 < patch-manifest-fox_"X".diff ("X" = the branch version: eg, 9.0, 7.1, 6.0, etc)
4. Change to the manifest's "bootable" subdirectory
5. Remove the "recovery" subdirectory, and clone the OrangeFox sources into a new "recovery" subdirectory
6. Change to the manifest's "vendor" subdirectory
7. Clone the OrangeFox vendor tree into a new "recovery" subdirectory

** It would be much easier to just run the orangefox_sync.sh script in the parent directory.
